#Black Lives Matter

The topic I chose was Black Lives Matter. To conduct this search, I used the parameters/search terms of: "black lives matter", "BLM", and "racism". For my second word bubble, I used terms like "black", "racist", and "justice".

##Resoning

As an advocate for Black Lives and the end of racism, I was curious to see what common words and terms would appear when people search for this topic. I was curious to see if a broader set of terms prompted a different set of results.

##Compare and Contrast

The word clouds were actually pretty different. Using the second set of terms provided much different results than the first set. The differences may be a result of the more vague words in the second set compared to terms that are much more specific. 

I was truthfully surprised that words like "justice" don't prompt for more serious results. I noticed a lot of results involving TV judges like Judge Judy rather than putting an emphasis on more serious issues like I had thought it would.
